Here is an example run of this script:

HERE IS YOUR PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS: bc1qeyp9e2fz54t3vc005l54z45qn46qvgcutxl4c6




This script generates two very important strings of characters.
  The first is your BITCOIN SECRET SEED PHRASE.
  The second is your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS.


Entropy is a vital part of bitcoin cryptography.  It must be very, very good.

Regarding you BITCOIN SECRET SEED PHRASE:
  Order matters. The sequence of the secret seed phrase words matters.
  Do not lose them. Without this sequence of 12 words, you have lost all your bitcoin. Keep them where you keep your most valuable documents; a safe or safe deposit box, a password manager (consider bitwarden, keepass).
  Do not share them. With them, anyone can steal your bitcoin.
  Bequeath them.  Add them to your succession plan, your last will and testament, to pass them, and thus your bitcoin, on to your heirs.
  Memorize them.  Best is to memorize them; add a weekly reminder to your calendar.
    A few good memorization techniques:

Buy bitcoin.  Sign up on a bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin every week or so (dollar-cost averaging, "stacking sats"). Consider swanbitcoin.com, pro.coinbase.com ("pro" is cheaper than regular coinbase.com).

Possess your bitcoin.
Regarding your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS:
Arrange for the bitcoin exchange to automatically withdraw or send your bitcoin to your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS, as much as possible, as often as possible, as soon as possible. Not your keys, not your coin. You really don't own your bitcoin until they have been sent by the exchange to your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS, which is protected by your private seed phrase (and thus your private key).

Study bitcoin. It is changing the world.  Learn about bitcoin as much as you can, as fast as you can.  Improve your bitcoin security over time.
