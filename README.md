# My (petjal) goal
...is to trim this good hard work of grondilu down to a single signed bash file that tech folks can use to help their friends, family, confidants safely simply start stacking sats asap. 2021-09-24

# Requirements
You need to install openssl, dc, and ent.


# Status

So far (2021-09-28), work on raspberry pi OS (debian based; linux/gnu).  

I'm working in branch pjdev https://github.com/petjal/bitcoin-bash-tools/tree/pjdev

# Bitcoin bash tools

This is a set of bash functions to generate bitcoin private keys and addresses.

When I first conceived these functions, tools like
[sx](https://sx.dyne.org/index.html) or its successor
[bx](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer) either did not exist or
I was not aware of their existence.  Now that I look at bx, it seems this
utility does everything that I wanted to do and more, except it's not written in bash.

I like bash for its ''out-of-the-box'' availibility in a GNU system, so I will likely continue
to developp bitcoin-bash-tools, aiming at making it a translation of bx into bash.
