# My (petjal) goal
...is to trim this good hard work of grondilu down to a single signed bash file that tech folks can use to help their friends, family, confidants safely simply start stacking sats asap. 2021-09-24

2021-10-04 I think we're essentially there. 

# Requirements
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) version 4 or above;
- [dc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_\(computer_program\)), the Unix desktop calculator;
- xxd, an [hex dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump) utility;
- openssl, the [OpenSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL) command line tool.

# Status

So far (2021-09-28), work on raspberry pi OS (debian based; linux/gnu). 

Update: 2021-10-03, works on Linux. (Need to check on raspberry pi; too tired, too late).

Moving from branch pjdev to master...never done that before...
