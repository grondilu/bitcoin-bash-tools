This script will generate two important strings of characters.
  The first is your bitcoin secret seed phrase.
  The second is your public bitcoin address.

But first, we need to generate and test your computer's entropy...
Entropy is a vital part of bitcoin cryptography.  It must be very, very good.
This step may take a couple of minutes. This script will appear to hang, please be patient...
Example output:
kernel_entropy_avail: 3659 (greater than 100 is good)
entropy test value: 1.000000 (1.000 is great)

HERE IS YOUR BITCOIN SECRET SEED PHRASE:
Example output:

  Order matters. The sequence of the secret seed phrase words matters.
  Do not lose them. Without this sequence of 12 words, you have lost all your bitcoin. Keep them where you keep your most valuable documents; a safe or safe deposit box, a password manager (consider bitwarden, keepass).
  Do not share them. With them, anyone can steal your bitcoin.
  Bequeath them.  Add them to your succession plan, your last will and testament, to pass them, and thus your bitcoin, on to your heirs.
  Memorize them.  Best is to memorize them; add a weekly reminder to your calendar.
    A few good memorization techniques:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_peg_system
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition

Buy bitcoin.  Sign up on a bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin every week or so (dollar-cost averaging, "stacking sats"). Consider swanbitcoin.com, pro.coinbase.com ("pro" is cheaper than regular coinbase.com).

This next step will take up to a minute or so...

Possess your bitcoin.
Below is your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS.  Arrange for the bitcoin exchange to automatically withdraw or send your bitcoin to your PUBLIC BITCOIN ADDRESS, as much as possible, as often as possible, as soon as possible. Not your keys, not your coin. You really don't own your bitcoin until they have been sent by the exchange to your public address which is protected by your private seed phrase (and thus your private key).

Study bitcoin. It is changing the world.  Learn about bitcoin as much as you can, as fast as you can.  Improve your bitcoin security over time.
